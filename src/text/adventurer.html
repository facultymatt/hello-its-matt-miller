<h3>In my free time you can almost always find me adventuring outdoors.</h3>

<p>I grew up camping, skiing, kayaking, and generally enjoying the outdoors but it was not until recently that I began to see the transformational effect that being active outdoors has on all aspects of my life.</p>

<p>Whether it’s perfecting my Greenland roll in a sea kayak, cross country skiing into the back-country, or training for a hundred mile endurance run - if it involves escaping into the beauty of nature count me in! I’ve discovered that while it’s incredibly rewarding, adventure isn’t always easy and the hard work and perseverance I’ve developed in the outdoors is something I bring back into my professional career.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a project that helps facilitate outdoor adventures and encourages that people unplug from the internet of things and reconnect to nature. If you want to know more reach out and say hello.</p>

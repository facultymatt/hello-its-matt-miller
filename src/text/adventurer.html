<h3>In my free time you can almost always find me adventuring outdoors.</h3>

<p>I grew up camping, skiing, kayaking, and generally enjoying the outdoors but it was not until recently that I began to see the transformational effect that being active outdoors has on all aspects of my life.</p>

<p>Whether it’s perfecting my Greenland roll in a sea kayak, cross country skiing into the back-country, or training for a hundred mile endurance run - if it involves escaping into the beauty of nature count me in!</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a project that helps facilitate outdoor adventures and encourages people unplug from the internet of things and reconnect to nature.</p>

<h3>I design experiences and products that make people smile.</h3>

<p>I’ve always been an artist, but It was not until college that I was introduced to design as a means to bring purpose and structure to my creativity and create change. Since then I’ve had formal instruction and professional experience in graphic design, service design, interaction design, and user-centered design.</p>

<p>I believe that collaboration and empathy are key aspects to successful design. The best designers constantly seek feedback on every iteration and this collaboration is key to honing concepts into successful designs. Empathizing with users by seeing the world through their eyes helps create designs that are actually useful and solve real problems these users face.</p>

<p>Some examples of things I have designed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A shared experience that connect people through their eyes</li>
  <li>New products which target market opportunities identified by research</li>
  <li>Exhibition spaces and graphics</li>
  <li>Innovative digital user interfaces</li>
  <li>Logos and branding guides for new businesses</li>
  <li>Tools to facilitate better shared experiences for groups</li>
</ul>

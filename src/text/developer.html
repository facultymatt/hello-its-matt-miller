<h3>I bring a skillset that is unmatched in other Software Engineers.</h3>

<p>I began web development when I built my first online art portfolio. I continued developing while in school, creating websites and hacking computer vision software. After school I immersed myself into a world of software engineering, production deploys, and test driven development.</p>

<p>Today I continue to combine creativity and design into my development work. I do more than just tackling bugs and backlogs - I empathize with users and design solutions for their needs while seeing these solutions through the entire software lifecycle.</p>

<p>Some projects Iâ€™ve worked on include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rich user interfaces to visualize GPS and sensor data from connected devices</li>
  <li>Gamified community design + voting platform</li>
  <li>Corporate document database search API and interface</li>
  <li>Customized quoting software for NASDAQ financial corporation</li>
  <li>Eye-tracking and blink detection using computer vision</li>
  <li>Single sign on interface to create cohesive user experience online</li>
</ul>

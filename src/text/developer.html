<h3>I will bring a skillset to your team that is unmatched in other Software Engineers.</h3>

<p>With over 8 years of web experience, a passion for test-driven development, and a background in art and user-centered design, I will bring a skillset to your team that is unmatched in other Software Engineers.</p>

<p>I most recently worked at a robotics startup with a team of stakeholders to develop single page web applications across the product lifecycle with AngularJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, D3, and Mapbox. Iâ€™m currently working on a SMS bot with a colleague which uses MeteorJS and sentiment processing to create a conversation with users. In the past I have developed eye-tracking and image recognition applications using OpenCV, C++, and Javascript. My passion for learning and innovating with new technology helps me quickly build robust and innovative solutions for the end-user.</p>

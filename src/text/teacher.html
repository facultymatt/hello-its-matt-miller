<h3>I’m a lifelong learner and teacher. </h3>

<p>I started an after school class for children where students used real tools to take apart common household appliances, and used design thinking to make new creations with the parts.  I leveraged hands-­on projects and creative uses of technology to make learning more fun, relatable, and effective. Now I am working to develop a class which teaches creative programming for the web using Javascript, html, and css.</p>

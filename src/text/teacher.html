<h3>I’m a lifelong learner and teacher.</h3>

<p>As a child, I disassembled my toys to see how they worked and sometimes even put them back together! This helped me to see the world around me as a collection of parts from which I could build anything I could Imagine.</p>

<p>I believe everyone should be able to see the world in this way, so I started an after school class for children to help foster this critical skill. Students used real tools to take apart common household appliances and used design thinking to make new creations with the parts. I leveraged hands-­on projects and creative uses of technology to make learning more fun, relatable, and effective.</p>

<p>When I learned web development, I was suddenly empowered to build and create in the digital space. I believe children must learn how to program so they are not destined to simply be consumers of digital products. I’m currently teaching a creative Javascript programming class for children which teaches these critical skills.</p>
